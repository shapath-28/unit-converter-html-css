 A static website design for converting temperature, weight, and distance using HTML and CSS only.
 🧮 Unit Converter (HTML & CSS Only)
This is a static design prototype of a Unit Converter website, created using only HTML and CSS. It includes sections for:

⚖️ Weight conversion (Kilograms ↔ Pounds)

📏 Distance conversion (Kilometers ↔ Miles)

⚠️ Note: This project does not include JavaScript logic for conversions. It's focused purely on layout and styling using the concepts learned so far.
